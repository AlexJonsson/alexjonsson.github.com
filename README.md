## Synopsis

This is a personal website for Alexander Jonsson. The audience for this website are both friends and professionals seeking to assess my professional skills. The blog section will mostly encompass data projects I find interesting, the resume section outlines my past professional and educational history, and the home page and footers intend to link everyone relevant social and professional profiles.


## Code Example

The library will house all necessary components needed to create a static website that allows me to occasionally post about projects or personal milestones, along with CV info and ways to contact me.

## Motivation

Web exposure is an awesome way to make myself known. I have wanted to make a website for a long time, and recently had more time on my hands to implement this goal.
